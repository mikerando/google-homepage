Project: Google Homepage

The first pass at attempting a superficial Google homepage.

There are a few formatting issues I couldn't resolve
    The footer centers when the window shrinks on the actual Google Hompage but, mine left aligns.

    The search bar size doesn't flex but instead stays the minimum length regardless of window size.

    More I'm sure but, those are the ones I spent time on and got no where. Better luck next time.
